## r-util

The functions written in r-util are from @roberrrt-s. The functions written are predominantly checking what kind of datatype it is, and if it is empty.

He has done this in a structured functional pattern where he is reusing the functions he wrote before it. AKA a prime example of the paradigm functional programming.

## util.js

Functions written for the sake of data sanitization of fetching data. The functions are written in ES6+ manner and are intended to be used in a functional programming paradigm. Most if not all functions have documentation written for their intended use.
