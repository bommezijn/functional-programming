# Functional Programming

This repo will be my journey through a different paradigm, The goal of this course would be to clean a dataset in a functional manner.

This course is specifically given by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam CMD. More information about the course specifically can be found at [CMDA-TT's github](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22).



## Features

- Cleaning dirty data for consumption
- Linting with [Standard](https://github.com/standard)
- Usage of promises
