# Functional Programming

This repo will be my journey through a different paradigm, The goal of this course would be to clean a dataset in a functional manner.

This course is specifically given by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam CMD. More information about the course specifically can be found at [CMDA-TT's github](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-21-22).



## Features

- Functional programming paradigm
- Cleaning dirty data for consumption
- Linting with [Standard](https://github.com/standard)
- <span style="color:red">More coming...</span>

### Upcoming features
- [ ] Lowercase all textual answers
- [ ] replace undefined with 'nvt'
- [ ] format dates to american date
- [ ] Fix the code to be up to code standards <sup>(never change initial datasets)</sup>
- [ ] Refactor code with promises
